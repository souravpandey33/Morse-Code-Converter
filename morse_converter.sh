# The given assignment is to take a text file as input and display
# its morse code and vice versa. 


# SOLUTION METHOD FOLLOWED

# According to our given problem statement we have initialised the morse and character
# values of each. Then we are taking a command line input and we are extracting the 
# extension of the file. If the extention is .txt then we perform the text to morse 
# conversion and if the extension is .morse then morse code to text conversion is done.


# TEXT TO MORSE ALGORITHM

# If the extension of the entered file is .txt then we will get right into conversion 
# to the morse code for the same. We will read each character from the file one by one.
# If the character read is found to be '\n' or next line operator then we also move to a
# new line in the display promt. If the character is a valid character then we print the
# respective morse value for it followed by a '/'. If the character is a blankspace ' '
# then we print a '/'. So the output comes is such a way that each letter of a word is 
# separated by a '/' and each word is separated by a '//'.


# MORSE TO TEST ALGORITHM

# If the extension of the entered file is .morse then we will get right into conversion 
# to the text for the same. We will read each character from the file one by one.
# If the character read is found to be '\n' or next line operator then we also move to a
# new line in the display promt. We have taken a string variable <word> in which we will 
# store the read characters until we find a '/'. When a '/' is found then we will print the
# <word> variable and again make it null and <flag> is made to 1. If we again find a '/' and
# the <flag> is 1 then we will print a blankspace and make <flag> to 0.



# Here I have predefined the alphabets and certain characters
# with their respective morse code values.
